🌌 Passion for Space
As the current Secretary of the AIAA chapter at UTEP, I'm deeply involved in the world of aerospace. My fascination with space has driven me to be part of initiatives that bridge engineering and exploration.

💻 Web Development Enthusiast
I'm also working as a Webmaster for the Career Center at UTEP, where I manage and maintain the website to help students navigate their career paths. I’m honing my skills in frontend and backend development, especially through my involvement with CodePath's Web 102 course, where I learned essential web development tools and techniques.

🔢 Parallel Computing & CUDA
Parallel computing has piqued my interest, and I recently completed the NVIDIA CUDA Introduction Course, learning how to leverage GPU acceleration for complex computations.

🤖 AI & Machine Learning
In the realm of AI, I built a neural network in Python to detect letters represented in matrix form. This hands-on project strengthened my foundation in machine learning. I also had the incredible opportunity to join the AI4ALL and CyberSecurity Camp at UTEP in the summer of 2023, where I explored the intersections of AI and cybersecurity.
